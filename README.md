# MSSE Bootcamp Blog Site Template

This repo contains files for a website for a UC Berkeley MSSE themed blog.

To use this blog, update line `21` in `_config.yml` to have the name of your repository. For example, if your repository is called `blog-team-1`, you will put

`baseurl: blog-team-1/`

on line 21.

You should next enable GitHub Pages to build from the main branch under repository settings.

This website uses the `minima` theme.
